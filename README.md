# Word Collector

A small application that allows you to collect words that are interesting to you, as well as add extra information about each word. The program also utilizes Merriam-Webster Dictionary API to get defintions for each word. This program uses React for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. Future ideas: flashcards for learning words, more definitions, better responsive mobile UI.
